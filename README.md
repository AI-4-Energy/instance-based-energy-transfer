# EcoBoost: Carbon-Aware Energy Forecasting with XGBoost

This repository contains the code and datasets used in our publication on short-term energy forecasting using environmental features such as weather and carbon intensity. The core model is based on XGBoost regression and evaluates the impact of environmental variables on energy consumption patterns.
